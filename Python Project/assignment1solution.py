Author: <name> (<student_id>)

Inspired from the human brain, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a 
type of computer vision model to classify images into certain categories.
In particular, in this assignment we will consider ANNs for the taks of
recognising handwritten digits (0 to 9) from black-and-white images with a
resolution of 28x28 pixels. In Part 1 of this assignment you will create
functions that compute an ANN output for a given input, and in Part 2 you
will write functions to "attack" an ANN. That is, to try to generate inputs
that will fool the network to make a wrong classification.

Part 1 is due at the end of Week 6 and Part 2 is due at the end of week 11.

For more information see the function documentation below and the
assignment sheet.
